About me:
</h3>
<p>
  It was my dream to become an Anthropologist. I fantasized learning about different cultures every day, working with others, and creating a better world. Although I really enjoyed studying Anthropology. One day I realized I just wasnâ€™t very happy, so even though I had been studying it for two years, I knew I had to fail fast to live the life I wanted, so I explored different directions for how to take my career, one day a game designer, the next a linguist. Then I took a Python class and found that software development offered everything I wanted out of my career and so much more.
</p>
<p>
	Just like Anthropology, coding is about learning every single day. I have an insatiable hunger for knowledge and with coding there is always another tool, language, or algorithm to learn. Just in the last two years I have learned so many tools and languages like Java, C++, HTML, JavaScript, and SQLite to name a few, but what I especially loved about it was the fact that when I code, I make mistakes and get instant feedback from the compiler that something went wrong. I love the hunt for bugs and the creation of solutions because every time I make a mistake, I fail forward and learn something new.
</p>
	As I continued (and still continue) through my CS degree at the University of Utah. I eventually created my own projects with teams of people, and I could get a glimpse of what building technology is really like. I love being a team player: designing software, supporting my teammates when they are stuck, and communicating to create the best product possible. Likewise, I love bringing value to my team by taking ownership of different features of the project and delivering.
<p>
  From this moment forward I knew I wanted to be not just a coder, but a Software Developer, I am passionate about learning and failing forward, working with other people, and most of all building technology to create a better world. I am looking to gain an internship as a Software Developer not only so I can catch a glance with how software is made in the real world, but mostly because I believe that with technology, we can change the world together.
